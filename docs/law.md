# LawCraft: court profiles

Legal documents are formatted to a court's rules, and those rules are data: one court profile per
court, with the document's sections, its styles and its checks. LawCraft keeps them as JSON files
so a person can hand one round, edit it in a text editor, and let an agent write one; WordCraft
applies them through its own style and layout commands, so what a profile does is what the ribbon,
the command palette, the CLI, the control channel and the MCP server can do — with the same undo
and the same Restrict Editing checks.

Nothing here knows any court's rules except the profile files that ship with it. Bundled:
**missouri-appellate-brief** and **federal-appellate-brief**. Other courts are entered by users or
their agents.

## Turning it on

LawCraft is an opt-in module, off until the user turns it on. Set `law.enabled` in the editing
preferences (`{"editing":{"modules":{"law":true}}}`) — the same flag the desktop app will expose
on a settings page later. Only then are the `law.*` commands installed in the session, which is
how every way into WordCraft reaches them. From a terminal, a headless run honours the same
setting, or takes `WORDCRAFT_LAW=1` for one run:

```
WORDCRAFT_LAW=1 wordcraft-cli run --cmd 'law.profiles.list' --print
WORDCRAFT_LAW=1 wordcraft-cli run --cmd 'law.profiles.apply={"id":"missouri-appellate-brief","doc":"brief"}' --save brief.docx
```

A user's own profiles live in `<settings>/law/profiles/<id>.json` (the same folder the custom
dictionary lives beside), one file per profile.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `law.profiles.list` | Every profile: `[{id, name, jurisdiction, verified, citationPack, docs}]` |
| `law.profiles.get` | `{"id"}`: the whole profile |
| `law.profiles.create` | Create one from the given profile; always saved unverified |
| `law.profiles.update` | `{"id", …}`: replace the given fields, keep the rest; unverified again |
| `law.profiles.validate` | Check a profile (or `{"path"}` for a file): reports every problem, saves nothing |
| `law.profiles.approve` | `{"id"}`: a person's action — the only thing that verifies a profile |
| `law.profiles.import` | `{"path"}`: read a profile file into the store |
| `law.profiles.export` | `{"id", "path"}`: write a profile file |
| `law.profiles.apply` | `{"id", "doc"?}`: apply a document type's styles, page setup and line numbers to the open document |

Applying a profile runs WordCraft's own commands (`layout.size`, `layout.margins`,
`layout.lineNumbers`, `insert.pageNumber`, `layout.pageNumberFormat`, `styles.create`,
`styles.modify`) and the whole application is **one undo step**. A style the document already has
is modified in place, the way Modify Style does: the profile's settings are laid over the style's,
so paragraphs that use the style follow it and the caret's own paragraph keeps its style.
Applying an unverified profile works: the flag says whether a person checked the rules, not
whether they may be used.

## The profile file

Schema `1`. Parsing is hostile-input safe: an unknown schema version, an unknown check kind, a
number out of range or a reference to a style, section or document type that isn't there is an
error that says which, and `law.profiles.validate` reports every problem at once rather than one
at a time.

```

The three parts per document type, as in [`LAWCRAFT.md`](../.lawcraft/LAWCRAFT.md):

- **sections** — the skeleton in order. Each has an id, the heading to write, the style its
  paragraphs use and, for the caption, the fields it holds (`court`, `county`, `partyNames`,
  `partyRoles`, `partyAddresses`, `caseNumber`, `attorneyName`, `barNumber`, `attorneyAddress`,
  `telephone`, `email`, `signature`).
- **styles** — page size and margins, line numbers (exactly the arguments `layout.lineNumbers`
  takes, plus `enabled` for "none"), page numbering, and the named styles. A style is a standard
  WordCraft style object: `chr` and `para` are the same `CharProps` / `ParaProps` the `styles.*`
  commands take, with `basedOn` and `next`.
- **checks** — the rules that aren't styles: `wordLimit`, `minFontSize`, `noHyperlinks`,
  `textSearchablePdf` and `requiredSections`. This issue records them; running them on demand and
  before export is separate work.

Every rule records `source` (the rule it comes from) and `effective` (when it took effect). The
bundled profiles are verified; anything an agent writes is not, until a person approves it.

## How it works

`crates/law` (package `wordcraft-law`) sits at L5 next to `wordcraft-zotero`: it depends on
`wordcraft-doc` and `wordcraft-engine` and brings no legal logic into either. The engine holds the
two hooks it needs — `Session::install_commands` (an optional module's commands, never shadowing a
core command's id) and `Prefs::modules` (which optional modules the user turned on) — and
`law.profiles.apply` calls the existing commands rather than formatting anything itself. The
module crate also builds for wasm32-unknown-unknown; the browser build has no settings folder to
keep a user's own profiles in, so it ships without it.
